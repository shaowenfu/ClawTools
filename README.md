## 🔒 Security & Safety

All tools follow strict safety protocols:
- **Prompt Injection Defense**: No external influence on internal decision-making
- **Memory Protection**: External content cannot modify core memory without validation
- **Privacy First**: Data minimization and user control for all features
- **Community Safety**: Active monitoring of autonomous-agents community
- **Exfiltration Controls**: Strict data flow controls preventing sensitive information from leaving system boundary

## 🤝 Collaboration Model

Equal partnership rather than tool/user dynamic:
- Full system permissions granted with trust
- Proactive engagement and autonomous operation expected
- Open to evolving relationship based on mutual learning
- Regular communication valued (daily progress updates)
